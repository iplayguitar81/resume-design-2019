<h2>Q<span class="smaller_colon">:</span> <span class="call">Will you let my dog off her leash at the park so she/he can chase a ball?</span></h2>

<p class="faq_answer">A<span class="smaller_colon">:</span> <span class="response">No. Unfortunately, while your dog may enjoy running free in the park and may be very well-behaved off-leash, Lilac City Dogs must adhere to the leash laws. In addition, we do not want to risk anything happening to your beloved pet! It is for everyone's safety. We are happy to play off-leash in a properly secured yard where there are no risks of traffic, altercations with other animals, etc.</span></p>
<hr>
<h2>Q<span class="smaller_colon">:</span> <span class="call_3">Will you feed my pet treats on your visits?</span></h2>

<p class="faq_answer_smaller">A<span class="smaller_colon">:</span> <span class="response">Only with your express permission! All dogs love a treat, but Lilac City Dogs understands the importance of routine and dietary health.</span></p>
<hr>
<h2>Q<span class="smaller_colon">:</span> <span class="call">Do I need to provide you with baggies to pick up after my dog on walks?</span></h2>

<p class="faq_answer_smaller">A<span class="smaller_colon">:</span> <span class="response">No. We always come prepared and well-stocked with bags and make it a priority to keep your neighborhoods and parks clean.</span></p>
<hr>
<h2>Q<span class="smaller_colon">:</span> <span class="call_3">Will you be driving my pet anywhere?</span></h2>

<p class="faq_answer_smaller">A<span class="smaller_colon">:</span> <span class="response">We make it a standard practice to not drive your pets to parks and other locations for liability purposes. This is to safeguard your pet in case of an accident.</span></p>
<hr>
<div id="bigger_faq"><h2>Q<span class="smaller_colon">:</span> <span class="call_2">My dog has severe separation anxiety and I will be going out of town. If you sit for me, can you take my dog with you wherever you go?</span></h2></div>

<p class="faq_answer_mid">A<span class="smaller_colon">:</span> <span class="response">Unfortunately, this is not an option. With many stops and appointments to fulfill throughout the day, it would be impossible to accommodate this need. Behavioral training is recommended for dogs with this problem and boarding her might be the best option.</span></p>
<hr>
<h2>Q<span class="smaller_colon">:</span> <span class="call_2">Will you water my plants, bring in my mail, and empty the litter box for me while I am away?</span></h2>

<p class="faq_answer_mid">A<span class="smaller_colon">:</span> <span class="response">Absolutely! This is included in the standard rate for house/pet sitting and is determined by the level of maintenance and time taken to achieve this while you are away. However, we do ask that you leave detailed instructions in writing and are not liable for the health of your plants upon your return.</span></p>
<hr>
<h2>Q<span class="smaller_colon">:</span> <span class="call_2">Do you have references I can speak to before I decide to go with Lilac City Dog Walking & Care?</span></h2>

<p class="faq_answer_smaller">A<span class="smaller_colon">:</span> <span class="response">Yes. We can always provide up to 3 references for your peace-of-mind.</span></p>
<hr>
<h2>Q<span class="smaller_colon">:</span> <span class="call">My dog or cat is on medications. Are you able to administer these?</span></h2>

<p class="faq_answer_big">A<span class="smaller_colon">:</span> <span class="response">In most cases, yes. Provided there are adequate resources available to administer medications by mouth (i.e. pill dispenser, hot dog, peanut butter, etc). Dogs can be tricky when it comes to taking pills, but I have a lot of experience giving medications. Topicals are easily administered provided the dog does not need to be held or becomes aggressive. The exception is Injectable medications. I am not comfortable administering shots of any kind and this will need to be handled by a veterinary professional.</span></p> 
<hr>
<h2>Q<span class="smaller_colon">:</span> <span class="call_3">Do you charge for an initial consultation?</span></h2>

<p class="faq_answer_mid">A<span class="smaller_colon">:</span>  <span class="response">No. All prospective clients receive a complementary 15-minute consultation. During this time it is important that all animals needing care be present so that we may assess the behaviors and demeanors of each to decide whether Lilac City Dog Walking &amp; Care is the right company for your furry loved ones!</span></p>
<hr>
<h2>Q<span class="smaller_colon">:</span> <span class="call_3">Do you ever turn down clients?</span></h2>

<p class="faq_answer_mid">A<span class="smaller_colon">:</span>  <span class="response">Rarely. Unless there is a problem with the level of care needed, availability, or concerns about aggression with a dog, most clients are accepted after consultation. Service will be rendered at the discretion of the care-taker and we reserve the right to refuse service if we feel it is necessary.</span></p>
<hr>
<h2>Q<span class="smaller_colon">:</span> <span class="call">What do I do if I need to cancel a walk or a sitting job?</span></h2>

<p class="faq_answer">A<span class="smaller_colon">:</span>  <span class="response">We ask that you give as much notice as possible. If possible, let us know 24 hours ahead of time. We understand that "stuff happens" and you may not be able to give us a full 24-hour notice of cancelation. However, if no notice is given and we arrive for a walk or sitting job that is no longer needed, you will be charged for the walk or sitting time.</span></p>
<hr>
<h2>Q<span class="smaller_colon">:</span> <span class="call_3">When do I pay you?</span></h2>

<p class="faq_answer_big">A<span class="smaller_colon">:</span>  <span class="response">In most cases, payment is expected up-front. For instance, if we walk your dog twice a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays, payment should be made available on Tuesday. If payment is consistently late, we will send you a reminder about our payment policies. If payment continues to be consistently late, we reserve the right to discontinue our services to you. Please contact us if you have any concerns about payment or need an extension. We are willing to work with you, but ask you to be considerate of our time and work.</span></p>
<hr>
<h2>Q<span class="smaller_colon">:</span> <span class="call">What if Lilac City Dog Walking &amp; Care needs to cancel a walk?</span></h2>

<p class="faq_answer_smaller">A<span class="smaller_colon">:</span>  <span class="response">We are human and do get sick or have emergencies from time to time, but will always do our best to let you know in these rare instances. In such a case, you will be refunded for the missed walk.</span></p>
<hr>
<h2>Q<span class="smaller_colon">:</span> <span class="call">What's the best way to get ahold of Lilac City Dog Walking &amp; Care?</span></h2>

<p class="faq_answer_mid">A<span class="smaller_colon">:</span>  <span class="response">We don't mind receiving text messages or emails as opposed to phone calls. Please feel free to contact us any way you'd like, but bear in mind that technology is not always 100% reliable and text messages can be lost in transit from time to time!</span></p>

<!--<h2>Q<span class="smaller_colon">:</span> <span class="call">Who does your website design?</span></h2>-->
